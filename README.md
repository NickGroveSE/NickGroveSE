- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Grove
- 👀 I am a Full Stack Developer with expertise in Frontend Development and Design. I really enjoy expanding on unique concepts and implementing sleek design.
- 🌱 Over the last month, I have working on a Vue x Go web app called Iris, check out the repo for the [Frontend Demo](https://github.com/NickGroveSE/IrisDemo). Currently with this project I am mastering my skills in Go before tackling the Backend, follow my progress here [Golang Mastery](https://github.com/NickGroveSE/GolangMastery)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are exciting and teams that are looking for Frontend expertise. My portfolio is not as expansive as many Frontend Devs and Designers out there, but I am great at visualizing the aesthetic/layout of a project while also being imaginative with my design ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at nickgrove.se@gmail.com
