- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Grove
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development and also love Design. Really enjoy expanding on unique concepts and implementing sleek design.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my Portfolio Website using Nuxt and very soon I will start my first Full Stack project with Vue.js [Scheduli](https://github.com/NickGroveSE/Scheduli) where I plan to work on mastering the framework and also learning Laravel, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind/SASS for the first time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are exciting and are looking for Front End expertise. My portfolio is not as expansive as many Frontend Devs and Designers out there, but I beleive I am great at visualizing the aesthetic/layout of a project while also being imaginative with my design ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
