- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Grove
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development and also love Design. Really enjoy expanding on unique concepts and implementing sleek design.
- 🌱 I’m currently finsihing off my <a to="https://nickgrove.netlify.app/">Portfolio Website</a> made using Nuxt and after that it is onto finishing up my website <a to="https://nickgrove.netlify.app/projects/MTGMetaTracker">MTGMetaTracker</a> 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are exciting and are looking for Front End expertise. My portfolio is not as expansive as many Frontend Devs and Designers out there, but I am great at visualizing the aesthetic/layout of a project while also being imaginative with my design ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at nickgrove.se@gmail.com
